# University-Network
In this application, we are studying the structure of a College Network. This college network provides services to students as well as faculties in various blocks also, labs from Academic block1, Academic block2, Academic block3 connected through this network. As a result, students and faculty can seamlessly access the network and this is important for staff to conduct lab exams as well as publish marks in a more efficient manner by the exam department.

This aids the faculties in time management. The following thesis sheds light on some main parts which are improved during the practical work: -
 - Maintaining student information
 - Supporting the campus management system.
 - Wi-Fi infrastructure for classes.
 - Security.
